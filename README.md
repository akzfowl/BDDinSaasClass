BDD and Cucumber
================


In this homework you will create user stories to describe a feature of a SaaS app, use the Cucumber tool to turn those stories into executable acceptance tests, and run the tests against your SaaS app.  

Specifically, you will write Cucumber scenarios that test the happy
paths of parts 1-3 of the Rails Intro homework, in which you added
filtering and sorting to RottenPotatoes' `index` view for Movies.

**Part 1: Create a declarative scenario step for adding movies**
**Part 2: Happy paths for filtering movies**
**Part 3: Happy paths for sorting movies by title and by release date**
